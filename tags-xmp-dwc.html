<div><h2>Darwin Core Schema</h2></div>
<p>The Darwin Core schema provides a set of XMP properties intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity.
 <ul>
  <li>Exiv2 keys are nested: <code>Xmp.dwc.&lt;Main Structure&gt;/dwc:&lt;Property&gt;</code></li>
  <li>The schema namespace URI is <code>http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/index.htm</code></li>
  <li>Darwin Core uses some <a href="tags-xmp-dcterms.html"><span>Qualified Dublin Core</span></a> properties</li>
  <li>The preferred schema namespace prefix is <code>dwc</code> except for Location properties which use <code>dcterms</code></li>
  <li>Some child properties under Record use the <a href="tags-xmp-dcterms.html"><code>dcterms</code></a> sub key prefix</li>  
 </ul>
